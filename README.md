Hi! The code is for Principal Component Analysis (PCA). It is an application of Machine learning that helps us to visualise our data. 
It is a common problem that whenever we collect data, it has more than 2 features, because of which we are not able to plot the data and analyse it.
PCA is an algorithm which helps us to identify the features which give us the maximum information about the data and hence we are able to plot it.
It is then further use to analyse data. The following is a very helpful link to understand PCA in a better manner.
(Knowledge of linear algebra would provide a great help in understanding PCA.) -->
